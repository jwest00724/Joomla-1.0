<p>The <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla!</a> project has long since abandoned the 1.0 version of the project.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are still sites using 1.0 that are happily doing the job they were built for and nobody has sufficient motivation to upgrade the site.</p>

<p>RHEL 6 and CentOS 6 include php 5.3 by default, and FreeBSD has moved on to php 5.4 Both of which are incompatible with Joomla 1.0.15.</p>

<p>This is intended as a stopgap while contemplating what to migrate the site to.</p>

<p>Head will pull an unofficial Joomla 1.0.16 that that will work with php 5.4 and php 5.3. (it is better tested with php 5.4.) It is also not tested at all with php 4.X or php 5.2, 5.1, or 5.0. (There is no reason that I know of that it won't work with older versions of php, but it has not tested.</p>
