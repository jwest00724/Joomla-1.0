# Joomla-1.0

Still making some improvements from to the Joomla code. To get ride of any error messages. Also updating some stuff to make sure it is able to work with php 5.5.

Currently being tested on php 5.5.12

Known issues
lots of Strict standards messages cropping up. While some have said just turn off the error reporting i do not find that as a acceptable solution. So i am going over the entire system to fix all these.
